# Tutorial for RNA-seq data preprocessing and analysis
This tutorial is made for the Master lecture "Introduction to Genomics" at D-BSSE, ETH Zurich. In this tutorial, a walk-through guideline is provided to lead people that are new to RNA-seq data analysis through their first analysis of an RNA-seq data set. The tutorial also includes some very basic introduction of the command line interface of the Linux system, which is heavily used when going through the pipeline.

The example data set presented in the tutorial is a subset of the RNA-seq data in the paper "Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of neocortical layers in humans, chimpanzees and macaques" published in Nature Neuroscience in 2017."
