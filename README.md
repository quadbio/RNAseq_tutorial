# Tutorial for RNA-seq data preprocessing ana analysis
This tutorial is made for the master lecture "Introduction to Genomics" in D-BSSE, ETH Zurich. In this tutorial, a walk-through guideline is provided to lead people who are new to the data analysis of RNA-seq data to do their first analysis of an RNA-seq data set. The tutorial also includes some very basic introduction of the command line interface of the Linux system, which is heavily used to go through the pipeline.

The example data set is a subset of the RNA-seq data in the paper "Comprehensive transcriptome analysis of neocortical layers in humans, chimpanzees and macaques" published in Nature Neuroscience in 2017."
